        <p class="content">Has been my favourite of the Air Max line ever since first discovering it. <br>It has always
            stood out to me, representing something quite different from styles like the BW or the 93 <br>that came
            before
            and after.</p>

        <p class="content">It was a different world<br> back when Nike first launched the Air Max 1 in 1987. ...
            Inspired by<br>
            the Pompidou Centre in Paris, Tinker, originally an architect for Nike,<br> had the idea of making the inner
            workings of the Nike Air Max cushioning system <br>visible in the Air Max 1.</p>

        <p class="content">One reason <br>the word “iconic” has become overused in sneaker journalism is that there are
            a
            handful of shoes so perfect that they’re both quintessential to a brand’s identity and continually
            available. The Nike Air Max 90 is one of those ubiquitous masterpieces.</p>

        <p class="content">Reception. <br> The 95 was a brand new approach to runner cushioning by being the first-ever
            shoe
            to also feature the<br> visible Air unit in the forefoot.<br> It was also the first Air Max model to have a
            black
            midsole.<br> Despite these innovations, the Air Max 95 was considered an outcast.</p>
